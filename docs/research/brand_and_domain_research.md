# Research: Brand Identity & Domain Strategy
**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Status:** Approved

## 1. Brand Name: "Aalam"
**Meaning:**
*   Arabic/Urdu/Hindi origin: "World", "Universe", "Realm", "Knowledge".
*   Aligned with Mission: "Mapping the history of the universe."

**Trademark & Conflict Analysis:**
*   **Finding:** "Aalam" is a common dictionary word. Generic terms are difficult to monopolize.
*   **Verdict:** No direct conflict with existing B2B IT shops (Aalam Info Solutions, aalam.io). We are B2C/Education.

## 2. Domain Strategy
**Primary Domain:** `aalam.xyz`
**Decision:** **KEEP**

**Analysis:**
*   **`.xyz` TLD:** Popular in Web3/AI. Signals modern tech. Matches "Universal" meaning.
*   **Recommendation:** Stick with `aalam.xyz` for MVP. Future option: `aalam.app`.

## 3. Business Structure (Sandbox Framework)
**Goal:** Clean transfer of ownership to Wife.
**Plan:** Create `admin.aalam@gmail.com` to own Domain, Hosting, Socials, and DB. Husband acts as contractor.
