# Release v1.0 Content Plan: The Museum of Infinite Connections

## Overview
For the first release, we aim to provide a diverse set of "Journeys" that showcase the power of the timeline engine. These journeys will span from the cosmic scale to the human scale, demonstrating the "zoom" capability of the application.

## Proposed Journeys

### 1. Cosmic Origins: The Beginning of Everything
*   **Theme**: Cosmology & Physics
*   **Scale**: Billions of Years
*   **Key Events**:
    *   Big Bang (-13.8 BYA)
    *   First Stars Form (-13.4 BYA)
    *   Formation of the Milky Way (-13 BYA)
    *   Formation of the Solar System (-4.6 BYA)
    *   Formation of the Earth (-4.5 BYA)
*   **Why**: Establishes the "Infinite" scope of the project.

### 2. The Vital Spark: Evolution of Life
*   **Theme**: Biology & Evolution
*   **Scale**: Millions of Years
*   **Key Events**:
    *   First Life (Prokaryotes) (-3.8 BYA)
    *   Great Oxidation Event (-2.4 BYA)
    *   Cambrian Explosion (-541 MYA)
    *   Rise of Dinosaurs (-230 MYA)
    *   Extinction of Dinosaurs (-66 MYA)
    *   Appearance of Hominids (-6 MYA)
*   **Why**: Demonstrates the biological progression leading to us.

### 3. The Human Story: Rise of Civilizations
*   **Theme**: History & Anthropology
*   **Scale**: Thousands of Years
*   **Key Events**:
    *   Agricultural Revolution (-10,000 BCE)
    *   Invention of Writing (Sumer) (-3400 BCE)
    *   Building of great Pyramids (-2560 BCE)
    *   Founding of Rome (-753 BCE)
    *   Fall of Constantinople (1453 CE)
    *   Industrial Revolution (1760 CE)
*   **Why**: Connects the "deep time" to recorded history.

### 4. Wires & Waves: The Evolution of Technology
*   **Theme**: Invention & Engineering
*   **Scale**: Centuries -> Decades
*   **Key Events**:
    *   The Wheel (-3500 BCE)
    *   Gutenberg Press (1440)
    *   Steam Engine (1712)
    *   Telegraph (1837)
    *   First Flight (1903)
    *   The Internet (1969)
    *   Artificial Intelligence (2020s)
*   **Why**: Shows the accelerating pace of innovation (our current "Communication" pilot fits here).

### 5. The Canvas of Time: History of Art
*   **Theme**: Culture & Expression
*   **Scale**: Millennia -> Centuries
*   **Key Events**:
    *   Cave Paintings (Lascaux) (-15,000 BCE)
    *   Venus of Willendorf (-28,000 BCE)
    *   Parthenon Built (-432 BCE)
    *   Renaissance (Da Vinci/Michelangelo) (1500s)
    *   Impressionism (1870s)
    *   Modern Art (Picasso/Dali) (1900s)
*   **Why**: Adds a cultural/aesthetic dimension to the scientific/historical focus.

## Implementation Strategy
1.  **Iterative Rollout**: Start with "Cosmic Origins" and "Human Story" to bookend the timeline.
2.  **Asset Generation**: Use AI tools to generate consistent, high-quality "cinematic" images for each event.
3.  **Cross-Linking**: Ensure events in "Technology" (e.g., Printing Press) are visible/linked when viewing "Civilization" or "Art" journeys.
