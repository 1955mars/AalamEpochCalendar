# Aalam Content Strategy: The Genealogy of Ideas

## 1. The Core Value Proposition: "Trace the Execution"
Most educational tools teach "The What" (Isolated Facts). Aalam's unique proposition is teaching **"The Why"** and **"The How"** (Causal Chains).

### The "Ancestry" Metaphor
We treat knowledge not as a list, but as a **Family Tree**.
*   **Standard View**: 1905 = Einstein discovers Relativity.
*   **Aalam View**: 1887 Michelson-Morley Experiment Fails -> Creates "Crisis in Physics" -> Forces Innovation -> 1905 Relativity.
*   **Goal**: Show the *necessity* of invention. Show the problem that birthed the solution.

### Key Concepts
1.  **Strict Causality**: Every major event should link to its dependencies. (e.g., *The iPhone* depends on *Transistors*, *Batteries*, *Multi-touch*).
2.  **The "Inverted Pyramid"**: Visualizing how one deep theoretical insight (e.g., Quantum Mechanics) supports massive modern industries (Computing, MRI, Lasers).
3.  **Cross-Pollination**: Innovations are often the convergence of unrelated fields (e.g., Printing Press = Wine Press + Metallurgy + Art).

## 2. Validation Plan: The "Vertical Slice" MVP
To validate if users find this "Causal" view engaging, we will build specific test content before engineering complex graph features.

### Experiment 1: "The Ancestry of AI" (Current Focus)
*   **Hypothesis**: Tracing AI back to ancient philosophy and weaving will be more engaging than just starting with Turing.
*   **Scope**: A single Journey timeline.
*   **Key Node Examples**:
    *   *Aristotle (300 BC)*: Formal Logic (The code of thought).
    *   *Jacquard Loom (1804)*: Programmable hardware (weaving patterns).
    *   *Ada Lovelace (1843)*: The first algorithm.
    *   *McCulloch-Pitts (1943)*: The artificial neuron.

### Experiment 2: UI Cues for Causality
*   **Idea**: Add "Unlocked By" or "Dependent On" badges in the UI.
*   **Goal**: Encourage users to click backwards to see the roots of an idea.

### Experiment 3: "Stubs" for Market Testing
*   Place "Coming Soon" cards for different genealogical topics (e.g., "The Roots of Democracy", "How We Conquered Pain") to measure click/interest rates.

## 3. Future Roadmap: The Unified Knowledge Graph
*   **Synchronicity Mode**: "What else happened in 1492?" (Horizontal connections).
*   **The Nexus**: Special nodes where timelines crash together (e.g., WWI, The Internet, Printing Press).
